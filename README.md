# roguelike in haskell

I wanted to try to write a roguelike in Haskell, so I made this to exercize with. I also wanted to do it mostly from scratch which is why I'm not using something like LambdaHack, as it already implements many of the algorithms that I wanted to learn about.

I also copied my [Pine](https://github.com/grinshpon/pine) project into this repo, which is a mostly-incomplete framework around SDL2. I'm hoping that by using it for an actual project I can revise and flesh it out, and then backport the changes into the actual pine repository.

Everything here is work-in-progress. As I stated, this is mostly an exercise for me.
